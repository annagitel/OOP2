# OOP2
This is the second project of the OOP course 
This project represent a weighted, directed graph. 
The graph is built from two main objects - Node and Edge 
the graph uses couple algorithms like - BFS Algorithm , Dijkstra Algorithm and more to to move and make calculations on the graph. 
This project has a GUI that uses the STDRAW library and represents a graphic view on the graph and changed by the algorithms applied to it.  [Learn More](https://github.com/annagitel/OOP2/wiki)
